In this chapter we are going to discuss ...

\section{Source of the electrical activity}
\label{sec:neuron}

As all known living organisms are composed of cells, so are humans and the human brain. The brain consists of nerve cells and non-neural cells, called neurons and glial cells respectively. There are approximately 86 billion neurons in the human brain and roughly as much non-neural cells \cite{neuroncount}. A typical neuron has a cell body, multiple nerve endings, or dendrites, and one nerve fibre, or axon. Both, dendrites and axons can branch multiple times, but axons can be much longer than dendrites. 

There are connections between neurons, through which neurons can interact with each other by sending electro-chemical signals. These connections are not static and can change over time. Functionally related neurons are connected to each other and form neural pathways \cite{neuralpathway}. The general rule is that a neuron sends signals through its axon and receives signals through dendrites. The connection between an axon and a dendrite is called a synapse. See figure \ref{fig:neuron_synapse} for an example of a neuron and a synapse.

To send signals, neurons must be able to maintain electrical potential, called membrane potential. Membrane potential is the difference in electric potential between the interior and exterior of a cell. When neurons are not sending signals, they have slightly negative membrane potential which is called resting potential. Negative resting potential is achieved by having more positively charged ions inside the cell than around it.

By having stable resting potential, neuron is able to send signals by rapidly increasing and decreasing the membrane potential along an axon. Therefore, the signal travelling along an axon is actually higher membrane potential. This event is called an action potential. To increase or decrease the membrane potential of a cell, ionophoric proteins are used. These proteins transport ions across the cell membrane.

Action potential is initiated by a certain threshold voltage, called threshold potential. When the membrane potential of a neuron exceeds threshold potential, the neuron sends signals to other cells. The neuron that receives the signal is called postsynaptic cell. Synaptic input in a postsynaptic cell can cause the membrane potential of the postsynaptic cell to increase or decrease. This is called postsynaptic potential and it can cause an action potential in the postsynaptic cell.

The following paragraph is based on article \cite{electric_field}. Postsynaptic potentials cause small current flows into the cell. To achieve electroneutrality, a balancing current from the interior to the exterior of the cell is needed. Location, where ions enter the cell is called sink and where ions flow to the exterior of the cell is called source. A source and a sink form a dipole. This is important, because it is possible to measure the electric field produced by these dipoles from the scalp. Although action potentials generate stronger currents, their duration is low and nearby neurons rarely fire synchronously.

\section{Functional neuroimaging}
\label{sec:neuroimaging}

As discussed in section \ref{sec:neuron}, neurons in the brain are sending electrochemical signals to communicate with each other. There are several techniques available to measure this activity and before we continue to discuss the biological background we will be giving a brief overview of these methods. Measuring an aspect of brain function is called functional neuroimaging and common measurement methods divide into haemodynamic and electromagnetic techniques.

Haemodynamic techniques measure blood oxygenation and blood flow in the brain. More oxygen has to be delivered to more active brain regions and this allows the brain activity to be measured. Haemodynamic techniques include \gls{fMRI}, \gls{fNIRS}, \gls{PET}.

Electromagnetic techniques measure either electrical activity or magnetic fields produced by the electrical activity along the scalp. Electromagnetic techniques include \gls{EEG} and \gls{MEG}. These methods have lower temporal resolution than haemodynamic methods, but measure only the activity in the outer layer of the brain. Temporal resolution is the smallest time period of neural activity that is reliably separated out by measuring technique.

To decide which method is best for controlling a robot, we will compare cost, portability and temporal resolution of each method. See table \ref{tab:neuroimaging} for details. For real time robot controlling, lower temporal resolution is better, because it enables faster decision making. We also prefer techniques that are portable and available for the consumer, so the usage would not be limited to certain location and would be available to the people in need. Considering all these arguments, it can be seen that the best choice for controlling a robot is an \gls{EEG} device.

\section{Electroencephalography}
\label{sec:EEG}

As already mentioned in the previous section, \gls{EEG} measures the electrical activity along the scalp. This electrical activity originates mainly from the electric fields generated by neurons, as discussed in section \ref{sec:neuron}. However, the electric potential generated by one neuron is far too low to be recognized. Therefore, approximately 108 neurons have to have synchronous electrical activity to a create measurable field \cite{field_count}. Furthermore, these neurons have to have certain orientation for the electric fields to add up and reach the electrode on the scalp. See figure \ref{fig:dipole_electric} for example.

\gls{EEG} measures the potential fields as the function of voltage versus time, using electrodes placed on scalp \cite{field_count}. Since voltage is the electrical potential difference between two points, one or more reference electrodes should be used. Then voltmeter can be used to measure the differences in voltage between two electrodes, one of which is a reference electrode.

Usually electrodes are placed on the scalp according to international 10-20 electrode location system. The outer layer of the brain can be classified into four lobes: temporal, occipital, parietal and frontal. 10-20 electrode location system uses a letter and a number to identify electrode location. The letter is the first letter of the brain lobe above which the electrode is located and therefore, the electrode measures the activity of this brain lobe.

In a broad sense, \gls{EEG} recording is linked to the state of the general activation of the brain \cite{VEP}. Therefore, due to the generality of the recording, we cannot see potentials evoked by certain event in the recording, because the general fluctuations are much larger than the evoked potential. A brain potential evoked by some event is called \gls{ERP}. \glspl{ERP} are associated with the information flow in the cortical areas and are usually obtained by an averaging technique \cite{ERP}. \glspl{ERP} are time locked to a stimulus event and therefore, may be recorded by presenting a stimulus with a certain time interval to a subject and calculating the average of \gls{EEG} signals recorded in the same time interval.

	\label{fig:voltmeter}
\end{figure}

\section{Visual evoked potential}

In section \ref{sec:EEG} we gave a brief overview of \glspl{ERP}. Now we are going to discuss one specific \gls{ERP}, called \gls{VEP}. As the name suggests, \glspl{VEP} are elicited by visual stimuli. The visual stimulus for eliciting a \gls{VEP} can be very simple, for example a white square blinking on a black computer screen.

The visual processing centre in humans is located in the back of the brain. The corresponding brain lobe is called occipital lobe. Therefore, when subject sees the stimulus, the signal travels from the eyes to the visual processing centre through the primary visual pathway \cite{neuroscience}. The primary visual pathway is a neural pathway. Neural pathways were also mentioned in the section \ref{sec:neuron}.

Since the occipital lobe is located in the back of the brain, when recording \glspl{VEP} with \gls{EEG}, electrodes located in the back of the head should be used. These electrode locations are identified with the letter O, as discussed in section \ref{sec:EEG}.

When comparing the \glspl{VEP} elicited in the central visual field and in the peripheral vision by the same stimuli, it can be seen that the stimulation of the central visual field produces larger \glspl{VEP} \cite{VEP_size}. This property is beneficial when presenting more than one stimulus to a subject and trying to identify, which stimulus is in the central visual field of the subject, or in other words, which stimulus is the subject looking at. 

To make the detection of \glspl{VEP} easier, \glspl{SSVEP} are used. If the visual stimulus is presented at a constant rate and the rate is so fast that the visual pathway cannot recover before the next stimulus is presented, then the elicited response becomes continuous and it is called the \gls{SSVEP} \cite{VEP}. See figure X for an example of \gls{VEP} and \gls{SSVEP}. \gls{SSVEP} is sinusoidal and therefore, it is easier to detect it in the \gls{EEG} recording.

\section{Emotiv EPOC}

In section \ref{sec:neuroimaging} we briefly compared different functional neuroimaging methods and concluded that currently \gls{EEG} is most suitable for our needs. But there is a wide variety of EEG devices available. See table \ref{tab:EEG} for details. As discussed in section \ref{sec:neuroimaging}, we prefer device that is available to the consumer.

OpenBCI is an open source brain-computer interface that provides access to all the data and algorithms, which makes it good for research, but it is not easy to use for non-specialist. From the more consumer friendly devices, Emotiv EPOC seems to offer good price-quality relationship.

Emotiv EPOC has 16 electrodes, two of which are reference electrodes. Reference electrodes have two different possible locations, P3 and P4 or behind the ears. Other electrodes have fixed locations AF3, AF4, F3, F4, F7, F8, FC5, FC6, P7, P8, T7, T8, O1, O2. See figure \ref{fig:electrode_locations} for illustration. Emotiv EPOC has internal sampling rate of \SI{2048}{Hz} and \gls{ADC} resolution of 16 bit. 

\gls{ADC} converts continuous voltage to the sequence of discrete values or in other words, an analog signal to a digital signal that can be processed by computer.
